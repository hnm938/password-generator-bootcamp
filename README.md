 # Super Secrete Password Generator
 The assignment to create a simple password generator was given, after a couple
 of hours and some basic HTML I created a pretty effective password generator.
 
 For this generator I spent some time using other password generators I could find
 online to figure how to generate symbols, numbers and uppercase letters and to
 determine how many of each there would be in the password relative to it's length.


I went with a simple design of white and red, bubbly modern font, rounded corners 
and a simple layout.
